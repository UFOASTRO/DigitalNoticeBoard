Id like you to fix and implement a some other things;

- Create cluster should have more customization relating to all the possibible cluster variations and policies in the database schema eg{cluster name, cluster description{should show on the invite link}}, cluster type(private or public etc...) should all be specified when creating a cluster.


Fix the UI for cluster Updates -- to something more minimalist; with less icons and more like notifications with text and match the UI scheme.


Implement (cluster settings) for all created clusters
which will be for people who have admin access to edit clusters
- with power to edit cluster information such as cluster name, cluster description,
- Manage Generated links (From shared cluster invites).
see the number of users and accounts on the cluster (with active states --  an active icon that indicates that the user is currently live on the cluster beside thier username)

The connector between notes should be more flexible and adapt in real time to movements of the notes 
also it should not be static 

Users shoudld be able to mark as read
Include Upload images to the chat section
revamp the chat section to look better
Integrate Google Calender API to add directly to schedule
can you include labels in the UI based on the category of stick note selcted (work, Idea, etc)
People who created the note should be able to edit it (edited should show as a label icon)
